                What is the difference between ESP and LTD models? For example, the ESP Snakebyte seems so similar to the LTD Snakebyte, but the price is significantly different!
            </p>
      
            <p>
                ESP guitars are built in our main factory and custom-shop located in Japan. These are completely built and assembled by highly skilled craftsmen using the best parts & wood selection. LTD guitars are produced in our factories outside of Japan (currently Korea, Indonesia, China, and Vietnam), and are manufactured in larger quantities using an assembly-line production method. This results in lower priced instruments. For more detailed information, here is a helpful article that explains the differences between our brands.

            <p>Can I order a custom guitar made to my own specifications?</p>
            <p>Yes. We have been building custom-ordered guitars since we started and are highly regarded in the guitar industry as "The" Custom Guitar Company. As long as the guitar you want us to build meets our expectations for functionality and does not infringe on any copyright matters, including but not limited to, any other guitar manufacturing company's proprietary designs, we can custom build it for you. For a price quote on a custom order, fill out the custom order form on our website and submit to your nearest authorized dealer</p>

                Is it possible to fit EMG pickups into my guitar that came with regular ESP/LTD pickups or Seymour Duncan pickups?
            </p>
      
            <p>
                Yes, except for 7-string models, all pickup routs are the same. This job has to be done by a professional repairperson to ensure the new parts are installed correctly. Please note: You cannot send your guitar back to ESP to do this type of work.

              <p>Where can I get my ESP guitar repaired?</p>
           <p>We recommend that you either have ESP repair your instrument, or and authorized ESP retailer or service center. For assistance please contact ESP or the original store where the instrument was purchased. You may also contact our customer service for additional service centers that may be located near you.</p>
